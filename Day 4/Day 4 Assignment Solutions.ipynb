    "### Ans:- In this question i have to research that whether addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division and modulo operations be performed on complex numbers.So, Based on my resaerch on complex numbers I came to an point that  we can only perform addition,multiplication ,addition, subtraction, multiplication, division on complex numbers.All these operations works completely fine.#but if I try to perform floor division and modulo operations be performed on complex numbers.It shows  me errrors like if i am going to perform floor divison it shows me the error like TypeError: can't take floor of complex  number and if I am  going to perform modulus operation it shows me error like TypeError: can't mod complex numbers.So, I can perform only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of complex numbers and if am going to perform operations like floor division and modulo operations i will face errors.Through Implementation i will show everythingh to you the result and the errors."
