    "\n",
    "### step 2 :-  After we have logged in or created an account in Github we have to go to start a project in Machine Learning it take us to the page where we can create our repository or we can simply go to create repository by exploring github.\n",
    "\n",
    "### step 3 :- Then after this we will have to create repository as LetsUpgrade AI/ML. We have to make this repository as public so we will not touch anything after that we will directly go to create repository.\n",

    "### step 4:- After creating the repo then we have to go Upload an existing file in the repo which we have created under the name LetsUpgrade AI/ML and we have to upload the assignment , we will have to upload the assignment in Day Folder from which day we have given the assignment. for example this is day 03 when i have been given the assignment so i will upload this assignment as Day 03 folder. \n",

    "### step 5 :- After uploading the assignment we have to copy the github link of the uploaded assignment.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "### step 6 :- After copying the link we have to open our Google Assignment Submission Page https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevTAqI8dJNbK9qDQA0POHMdKGaZqS9c7nO3W0ture1nNfqVg/viewform then we will have to submit all the required fields. We will  Have to Check whether our link works or not in incognito mode in Google Chrome before giving the link to the Assignment Submission Page. Then We will Have to click on Submit option and our Assignment will be submitted. \n",
